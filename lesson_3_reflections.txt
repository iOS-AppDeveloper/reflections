When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository when collaborating with other 
    people on the same project and/or when the repository contents would be 
    of interest to other people, in order to make it easily accessible.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I want to pull changes manually so that I know when they've been added to 
	my local repository and can be aware of any possible conflicts with what
	I'm working on. I might want to postpone doing a pull until I've finished
	what I'm doing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is a copy of a repository.  It contains all of the commits, branches, and 
    history contained in the original repository.  A local clone of a remote
    repository allows you to work locally on your own machine and independently of
    work that others may be doing on files in the original remote repository.  A fork 
    is a clone that is done on the GitHub website, usually to make a copy of a 
    repository that you don't have permission to change. A fork is a copy that you can 
    modify for your own purposes while not affecting the original repository, but retains
    information about who created the original.  A branch is a label for a commit and 
    identifies modifications to files that are done in parallet with modifications on 
    another branch within the same repository.  A branch can be used to commit changes to
    a repository so they can be tracked while still keeping them separate from other work
    being done on other branches until such time that it makes senses to merge the changes
    together.
